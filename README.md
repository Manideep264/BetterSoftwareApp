# BetterSoftwareApp

This is a React Native application for Sign Up and Login forms, designed as part of an internship evaluation.

## Features
- **Sign Up Form**: Includes email validation, password validation, and a password strength indicator.
- **Login Form**: Includes "Remember Me" functionality that saves the email to local storage.
- **Accessibility**: Includes ARIA-like roles and labels for improved user experience.

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Start the application with `npm start` and run it on a device/emulator.

## Design Choices
- Used **Formik** and **Yup** for form handling and validation for simplicity and robustness.
- TypeScript for better type safety and maintainability.

## Assumptions and Limitations
- No backend integration; forms are standalone.
- Limited styling for simplicity.

Enjoy using the app!
